# python-tests
Just some small projects test and while I learn the Python programming language

### Python Wars
A minimalistic and expansible take on the snake game. My first and, for now, only python project. Although the code is entirely written in english, the comments are written in spanish (my native language). For now I don't plan on changing the language of the comments because it's easier for me to present the code in my country in the way it is now. It's a preety easy-to-read code as it is without the comments, but I'll work hard towards making it as readable as posible while I familiarize myself with python conventions.

For building the code you will need **Python 2.7.11** and **PyGame 1.9.1**
